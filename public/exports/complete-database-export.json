A matte black stylized 3D human character with low details kneels to gather vegetables from the soil, with a deep red rim light outlining the figure. Rows of plants and terrain are modeled realistically but rendered in smooth matte materials with red highlights on the vegetables and nearby tools. The atmosphere is moody, with deep shadows and a faint warm glow at the ground level. Cinematic, serious, minimal, icon-like aesthetic. No text, no subtitles, minimal clutter.",

A matte black stylized 3D human character with low details sits in the driver's seat, outlined by a red glow. The dashboard, steering wheel, and controls are rendered in smooth matte materials with selective red highlights on key mechanical parts. The environment is shadow-heavy, with a focused warm light emphasizing the silhouette's form. Cinematic, serious, minimal, icon-like aesthetic. No text, no subtitles, minimal clutter.",

Le graphique (élément central)\nType\n\nCourbe de marché (actions, bitcoin, macro)\n\nParfois histogramme (crises, pics historiques)\n\nToujours orienté vers la droite (projection future)\n\nTraitement visuel\n\nLigne principale noire ou grise\n\nZone rouge remplie pour signaler :\n\ndanger\n\nchute\n\nstress\n\ninversion\n\nPartie droite souvent mise en avant (zoom, accent, flèche)\n\nRôle\n\nLe graphique n'explique rien, il suggère une catastrophe imminente ou un point de rupture.\n\n3. Le texte (hook visuel)\nCaractéristiques\n\n2 à 5 mots maximum\n\nMajuscules\n\nPolice sans-serif, très épaisse\n\nNoir ou rouge\n\nPlacé :\n\nen haut à gauche\n\nou centré en haut\n\nExemples de formules\n\n\"IT'S HAPPENING.\"\n\n\"FINAL PHASE\"\n\n\"THIS IS A PROBLEM.\"\n\n\"IT'S STARTED.\"\n\n\"THEY ARE WRONG.\"\n\nFonction\n\nCréer urgence\n\nCréer conflit\n\nCréer certitude\nAucune nuance, aucune condition.\n\n4. Les flèches et annotations\nPrésence quasi systématique\n\nFlèche courbe noire pointant :\n\nun sommet\n\nune rupture\n\nla partie droite du graphique\n\nParfois :\n\nAnnées clés (\"2008\", \"2025\")\n\nÉtiquettes minimales (\"INVERSION\", \"DEC 2025\")\n\nRôle\n\nGuider l'œil sans demander d'effort cognitif.\n\n5. Palette et contraste\n\nBlanc dominant → pureté, clarté, sérieux\n\nRouge → danger, sang, alerte, perte\n\nNoir → autorité, factualité\n\nAucun décor, aucune texture, aucune photo humaine.\nZéro distraction.\n\n6. Absences notables (volontaires)\n\nIl n'y a jamais :\n\nde visage\n\nd'émotion humaine\n\nde logo visible\n\nde texte explicatif\n\nde chiffres complexes\n\nde titres longs\n\nTout ce qui ralentit le clic est supprimé.\n\n7. Effet psychologique global\n\nLa composition vise à déclencher :\n\nAnxiété anticipée\n\nFOMO inversé (peur de rester exposé)\n\nSentiment d'information interdite\n\nAutorité silencieuse (\"le graphique parle de lui-même\")\n\nVisuellement, ça dit :\n\n\"Tu ne comprends pas encore, mais quelque chose de grave arrive.\"\n\n8.

BE CREATIVE TO MAKE YOUR OWNS.\n\nANSWER WITH PLAIN TEXT SCRIPT ONLY WITHOUT TITLES OR SUBTITLES, MINIMUM 4000 words.\n\nWrite me a YouTube script by following (but not copying word for word) the following structure.\n\nVideo Topic: Buy, Borrow, Die: How the Rich Actually Avoid Taxes\n\n\nAudience : \n\n25+ american males\n\n---\n\nACT 1: EMOTIONAL HOOK (must be around one hundred words)\n\nOpen with an historical event that will trigger emotional and viewer intesrest.\n\nTransition phrase to next part.\n\n\n---\n\n## ACT 2: CURIOSITY GAP\n\n### Tease the Mechanism (must NOT be boring and too long)\n- State what's happening WITHOUT explaining how yet\n\nIntroduction: \"My name is David and I spend way too much time thinking about [relevant financial topic]. If you're someone who [describes target audience struggle], make sure to hit that subscribe button and give this video a thumbs up if this helps you out.\"\n\n### Promise the Reveal\nUse one of these proven phrases (or variation you make):\n- \"By the end of this video, you'll understand [specific mechanism] that [financial institutions] don't want you to know\"\n- \"I'm going to show you the exact [system/pattern/trick] that [group] uses to [profit/control/manipulate]\"\n\n### Set Up the Journey\n- \"As usual, I need to tell you a story\"\n\n---\n\n## ACT 3: HISTORICAL PARALLEL\n\n### Choose Your Historical Story\nPick an event that contains the SAME PATTERN as your main topic but in a different context:\n\n**Story Selection Criteria:**\n- Must be from a different time period (at least 20+ years ago)\n- Must involve similar financial mechanics (debt spirals, concentration risk, manipulation, etc.)\n- Must have clear villains and victims\n- Must have a dramatic outcome\n\n**Example Parallel Stories:**\n- Main topic: Index fund risk → Historical story: Nifty Fifty stocks crash (1970s)\n- Main topic: Crypto volatility → Historical story: Tulip mania (1630s) or South Sea Bubble (1720)\n- Main topic: Real estate speculation → Historical story: 2008 housing crisis or Japanese asset bubble (1980s)\n- Main topic: Corporate debt → Historical story: Enron collapse (2001) or Mexico debt crisis (1982)\n- Main topic: Bank manipulation → Historical story: LIBOR scandal (2012) or London Gold Pool (1960s)\netc….\n\n### Structure Your Historical Narrative\n\n**Opening\n- Set the scene with 2-3 specific details that make it vivid\n- Example: \"Let me tell you about Mexico in 1982. The government had borrowed billions in US dollars, oil prices were high, and everything seemed fine. Until it wasn't.\"\n\n**Rising Action \n- Explain the mechanism in 3-4 clear steps\n- Use simple cause-and-effect language\n- Insert a pattern interrupt every 90 seconds (rhetorical question, \"but here's the catch,\" data drop)\n- Step 1: [Action taken]. Step 2: [Consequence]. Step 3: [Escalation]. Step 4: [Crisis point].\n\nPattern Interrupts (every 90 seconds):\nRhetorical question: \"Why would they do this? [Brief answer]\"\n\"But here's the catch...\" reveal\nSpecific data point with emphasis\n\n**Crisis Point :**\n- Describe the moment everything collapsed\n- Use emotional language: \"panic,\" \"desperate,\" \"catastrophic\"\n- Give specific numbers: \"Lost $X billion in Y days\"\n- Example: \"In August 1982, Mexico announced it couldn't pay its debts. Within 48 hours, $87 billion in loans were at risk. Banks that had lent money were suddenly facing bankruptcy themselves.\"\n\n**Aftermath :**\n- Who won? Who lost?\n- What was the long-term consequence?\n- EXAMPLE Template: \"[Winners] walked away with [gains]. [Losers] were left with [losses]. And here's the kicker: [surprising twist about who really profited].\"\n\n**Bridge to Main Topic :**\n- \"So what does this have to do with [your main topic]? Everything.\"\n- Draw explicit parallel: \"Just like [historical villain] profited from [historical pattern], [modern villain] is profiting from [modern pattern].\"\n\n\n---\n\n## ACT 4: RELATABLE ANALOGY\n\n### Create Your Everyday Equivalent\n\n**Analogy Selection Rules:**\n- Must involve something viewers interact with regularly (home, car, restaurant, phone, grocery shopping)\n- Must use round numbers that are easy to calculate mentally ($100, $1,000, $10,000, not $1,247)\n- Must have clear emotional stakes (losing your house, wasting years of savings, missing opportunity)\n\n**Template Structure:**\n\"Imagine you [common situation]. You [action] worth [$X]. [Positive outcome happens]. You feel [emotion]. But then [negative event]. Now you [consequence]. The [item] is worth [$Y], you owe [$Z], and you've lost [$X-Y].\"\n\n**Example (Home Equity):**\n\"Imagine you own a house worth $300,000 with a $200,000 mortgage. You take out a $50,000 home equity loan to invest. Your investment doubles to $100,000. You feel rich. But then the market crashes 50%. Your investment is now worth $50,000, you still owe $250,000 on the house, and if you need to sell, you're underwater.\"\n\n**Example (Restaurant Concentration):**\n\"Imagine you own a restaurant with 30 menu items. Seven of them generate 80% of your revenue. You feel successful because revenue is high. But then food trends change and those 7 items go out of style. Suddenly 80% of your revenue disappears, but you still have rent, staff, and inventory costs for all 30 items. You're not just less profitable—you're bankrupt.\"\n\n\n\n### Connect Analogy to Main Topic\n\n---\n\n## ACT 5: ANTAGONIST REVEAL\n\n### Identify the Villain\n\n**Who benefits from this pattern?**\n- Banks, fund managers, brokers, institutions, regulators, corporations etc…\n- Be specific: Not \"the financial industry\" but \"index fund providers like [specific companies]\"\n\n### Explain the Motive\n\n**Why do they do it?**\n\n### Reveal the Method \n\n**How do they hide it?**\n- Give 3 specific tactics they use to obscure the truth\n\n### Emotional Reframe\n\n**Shift from victim to informed player:**\n\n---\n\n## ACT 6: EMPOWERMENT \n\n### Action Step 1 \n**Immediate defensive move:**\n- What should viewer do TODAY to protect themselves?\n- Must be specific and actionable (not \"be careful\" but \"check X metric in your account\", not BASIC things they've heard 1000 times)\n\n\n\n-----------\n\nVERY IMPORTANT : \n\n\nStyle Requirements:\n\nConversational tone with natural speech patterns (\"Here's the thing...\", \"Look,\", \"Um\")\nChallenge common financial assumptions early\nInclude specific, shocking statistics with realistic sources\nUse concrete mathematical examples with real dollar amounts\nExplain the psychological shifts behind financial decisions\nAddress viewer objections (\"Now you might be thinking...\")\nUse relatable analogies to explain complex concepts\nBuild to increasingly surprising revelations\nInclude phrases like \"Here's what most people don't realize...\" and \"This is where it gets really interesting...\"\n\nVery important for date and numbers : \n\nDo not write numbers like \"$900k\". Write \"nine hundred thousand dollars\".\nDo not write \"$3 billion\". Write \"three billion dollars\".\nDo not write \"$3.4 billion\".
