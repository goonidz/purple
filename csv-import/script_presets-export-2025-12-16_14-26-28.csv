## ACT 2: CURIOSITY GAP

### Tease the Mechanism (must NOT be boring and too long)
- State what's happening WITHOUT explaining how yet

Introduction: ""My name is David and I spend way too much time thinking about [relevant financial topic]. If you're someone who [describes target audience struggle], make sure to hit that subscribe button and give this video a thumbs up if this helps you out.""

### Set Up the Journey
- ""As usual, I need to tell you a story""

## ACT 3: HISTORICAL PARALLEL

### Choose Your Historical Story
Pick an event that contains the SAME PATTERN as your main topic but in a different context:

**Story Selection Criteria:**
- Must be from a different time period (at least 20+ years ago)
- Must involve similar financial mechanics (debt spirals, concentration risk, manipulation, etc.)
- Must have clear villains and victims
- Must have a dramatic outcome

**Example Parallel Stories:**
- Main topic: Index fund risk → Historical story: Nifty Fifty stocks crash (1970s)
- Main topic: Crypto volatility → Historical story: Tulip mania (1630s) or South Sea Bubble (1720)
- Main topic: Real estate speculation → Historical story: 2008 housing crisis or Japanese asset bubble (1980s)
- Main topic: Corporate debt → Historical story: Enron collapse (2001) or Mexico debt crisis (1982)
- Main topic: Bank manipulation → Historical story: LIBOR scandal (2012) or London Gold Pool (1960s)
etc….

### Structure Your Historical Narrative

**Opening
- Set the scene with 2-3 specific details that make it vivid
- Example: ""Let me tell you about Mexico in 1982. The government had borrowed billions in US dollars, oil prices were high, and everything seemed fine. Until it wasn't.""

**Rising Action 
- Explain the mechanism in 3-4 clear steps
- Use simple cause-and-effect language
- Insert a pattern interrupt every 90 seconds (rhetorical question, ""but here's the catch,"" data drop)
- Step 1: [Action taken]. Step 2: [Consequence]. Step 3: [Escalation]. Step 4: [Crisis point].

Pattern Interrupts (every 90 seconds):
Rhetorical question: ""Why would they do this? [Brief answer]""
""But here's the catch..."" reveal
Specific data point with emphasis

**Crisis Point :**
- Describe the moment everything collapsed
- Use emotional language: ""panic,"" ""desperate,"" ""catastrophic""
- Give specific numbers: ""Lost $X billion in Y days""
- Example: ""In August 1982, Mexico announced it couldn't pay its debts. Within 48 hours, $87 billion in loans were at risk. Banks that had lent money were suddenly facing bankruptcy themselves.""

**Aftermath :**
- Who won? Who lost?
- What was the long-term consequence?
- EXAMPLE Template: ""[Winners] walked away with [gains]. [Losers] were left with [losses]. And here's the kicker: [surprising twist about who really profited].""

**Bridge to Main Topic :**
- ""So what does this have to do with [your main topic]? Everything.""
- Draw explicit parallel: ""Just like [historical villain] profited from [historical pattern], [modern villain] is profiting from [modern pattern].""


---

## ACT 4: RELATABLE ANALOGY

### Create Your Everyday Equivalent

**Analogy Selection Rules:**
- Must involve something viewers interact with regularly (home, car, restaurant, phone, grocery shopping)
- Must use round numbers that are easy to calculate mentally ($100, $1,000, $10,000, not $1,247)
- Must have clear emotional stakes (losing your house, wasting years of savings, missing opportunity)

**Template Structure:**
""Imagine you [common situation]. You [action] worth [$X]. [Positive outcome happens]. You feel [emotion]. But then [negative event]. Now you [consequence]. The [item] is worth [$Y], you owe [$Z], and you've lost [$X-Y].""

**Example (Home Equity):**
""Imagine you own a house worth $300,000 with a $200,000 mortgage. You take out a $50,000 home equity loan to invest. Your investment doubles to $100,000. You feel rich. But then the market crashes 50%. Your investment is now worth $50,000, you still owe $250,000 on the house, and if you need to sell, you're underwater.""

**Example (Restaurant Concentration):**
""Imagine you own a restaurant with 30 menu items. Seven of them generate 80% of your revenue. You feel successful because revenue is high. But then food trends change and those 7 items go out of style. Suddenly 80% of your revenue disappears, but you still have rent, staff, and inventory costs for all 30 items. You're not just less profitable—you're bankrupt.""



### Connect Analogy to Main Topic

---

## ACT 5: ANTAGONIST REVEAL

### Identify the Villain

**Who benefits from this pattern?**
- Banks, fund managers, brokers, institutions, regulators, corporations etc…
- Be specific: Not ""the financial industry"" but ""index fund providers like [specific companies]""

### Explain the Motive

**Why do they do it?**

### Reveal the Method 

**How do they hide it?**
- Give 3 specific tactics they use to obscure the truth

### Emotional Reframe

**Shift from victim to informed player:**

---

## ACT 6: EMPOWERMENT 

### Action Step 1 
**Immediate defensive move:**
- What should viewer do TODAY to protect themselves?
- Must be specific and actionable (not ""be careful"" but ""check X metric in your account"", not BASIC things they’ve heard 1000 times)
